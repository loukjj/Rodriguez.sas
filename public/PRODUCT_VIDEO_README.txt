Place your product background video file named `product-video.mp4` in this folder (web-app/public) to enable the video background on the products page.

Recommended settings:
- Format: MP4 (H.264 video + AAC audio)
- Resolution: 1280x720 (720p) or 1920x1080 (1080p)
- Duration: short loop (5–15s) to reduce filesize
- Optimize/encode for web: CRF ~23 with fast decoding presets

Example: copy your file here and reload the dev server. The products page will automatically play it as a subtle background.

If you prefer a sample video, you can download a short looping clip (e.g., from Pexels / Coverr) and save it as product-video.mp4 in this folder.
